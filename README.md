PreRequisites:
PHP 5.6 and mysql 5.1 are codeigniter 3 server requirements(https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/requirements.html) and above but I would say mysql 5.6 and above. 

Installation:
Run the database.sql file found in the root directory inside your mysql. this will create a database called phonebook which will be used in the application.
If you already have a database by that name already, then you can changed the database name inside the script, and also changed the corresponding
reference in codeginiter config/database.php to whatever new databse name you would like to use.

These are just some sample use cases to walk you through the application
